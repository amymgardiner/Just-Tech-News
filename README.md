## About

Just Tech News is a tech news website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles.

I used Sequelize, an object-relational mapping (ORM) library, to simplify MySQL queries, added password hashing so that users can create secure passwords, and connected my application to JawsDB, a MySQL add-on for Heroku.

The [Heroku Link](https://powerful-gorge-74483.herokuapp.com/) for the app is here. At the moment, only the back-end is built as part of Module 13's Lesson Activity for the Coding Boot Camp I'm currently enrolled in.
