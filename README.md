## About

Just Tech News is a tech news website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles.

For Module 13, the first part of building this app from the back-end, I used Sequelize, an object-relational mapping (ORM) library, to simplify MySQL queries, added password hashing so that users can create secure passwords, and connected my application to JawsDB, a MySQL add-on for Heroku.

For Module 14, I created the front end using Handlebars.js, a popular templating engine. The application’s codebase is structured to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, to ensure a separation of concerns. Also, to provide authentication, I built on the password hashing from the application’s back end so that logged-in users can update and delete their posts through a special dashboard interface.

**Update: Due to the removal of Heroku's free product plans, I have found another free hosting platform that was not taught in the bootcamp. The [Heroku link](https://powerful-gorge-74483.herokuapp.com/) for this site no longer works. Please view this site with the new link below. Thanks!**

## Where to View

`Note: I use Render now for hosting my school projects, on their free plan. A free plan will spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity, and the next request will spin it back up, which can take awhile. So please be patient as the site may take some time to initially load due to Render restrictions.`
